# Django-Budget-app

This is a web-application to keep track of a monthly budget. 

Users can enter transactions (incomes/expenses/loans) with various details and select a repeat pattern for each transaction. The app calculates a monthly budget 
and shows the total amount for the selected month. It also involves a calendar view to display each transaction for the selected month on the corresponding 
date(s).

Users can create and join groups to create a shared budget that fulfills the same tasks (this could be useful for couples, families, sports groups etc.).


The app is currently not running on a remote server. To run it, run a virtual environment with django and black installed, navigate into the budget directory 
and run the command 'python manage.py runserver' in the terminal.
